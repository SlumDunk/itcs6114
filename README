Description of my program design:
         1. The function of method 'readInputFile(String inputFilePath)' is to read the input File.
         2. The function of method 'splitNumbers(String strNumbers)' is to split a string of numbers and transfer it into an array.
         3. The function of method 'insertSort(List<Integer> numberList)' is to sort an array of integers with algorithm of insertion sort.
         4. The function of method 'transList2Str(List<Integer> numberList)' is to transfer an array of numbers into a string.
         5. The function of method 'writeOutputFile(String outputFilePath, StringBuffer content)' is to ouput the result to a file.

         so the progress is that:
            1. read the input file
            2. loop reading each line of the file until there is no new line
                2.1 transfer string of each line into a sub-list of numbers, and add them to the numberList
            3.sort the numbers in the numberList with algorithm of insertion
            4. write the final result to the ouput file.


breakdown of my algorithm:
         int len = numberList.size();// the length of array
         int tmp;// variable to store the temporary value
         int j;
         for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {//loop the whole array of numbers
             tmp = numberList.get(i);// assigns the current number to tmp
             for (j = i; j > 0 && tmp < numberList.get(j - 1); j--) {// move the number to the back position if it is bigger than tmp
                    numberList.set(j, numberList.get(j - 1));
             }
             //move current number to the right place
             numberList.set(j, tmp);
         }


compiler: 1.8.0_111

platform: MacOS

summary of key factors:
    1. read file successfully.
    2. the number must be integer
    3. the content of the input file must be correct format
    4. implement the algorithm of insertion sort correctly.
    5. write the ouput file successfully.

data structure design:
    1. transfer each line of the input file into an list of integer.
    2. transfer the sorted numbers in the list into a String.
